Magic Cat Academy 1
---

This is an offline backup copy of the Magic Cat Academy game by Google.
The game has been slightly modified to run in fullscreen.
Note: This repo only contains the assets for the **2016** version of the game. This is the first game in the series and not the 2nd one in the series. (2020)
Credit goes to gameblabla for giving me inspiration in doing the same archival thing they did for the Doodle Champion Island Games but for this game instead.

Playing the game offline
=========
To get started, you will need to host your own HTTP server.

Either run:
`python3 -m http.server`
Or
`npx http-server --port 8000`
in command prompt or a terminal of choice and it will start a web server which you can access at `127.0.0.1:8000` or `localhost:8000`.
